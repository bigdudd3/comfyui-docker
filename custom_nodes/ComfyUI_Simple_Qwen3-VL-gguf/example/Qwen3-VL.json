A 5-second breakdown is also required, which can be divided into three segments, each with a duration that matches the logic of the action. The prompt words should be concise and demonstrate dynamic movement.\n\nLight source types: daylight, artificial, moonlight, practical, campfire, fluorescent, cloudy, mixed, clear sky, etc.\nLight types can be described as: soft, hard, overhead, side, backlight, downlight, edge, silhouette, low contrast, high contrast.\nTime period: day, night, twilight, sunset, dawn, sunrise. Close-up, close-up, medium shot, medium close-up, medium panorama, panorama, wide angle. Describe composition types: centered composition, balanced composition, side reconstruction, symmetrical composition, and short-side composition.\nLens Description - Lens sizes: mid-focal length, wide-angle, telephoto, telephoto, ultra-wide-angle (fisheye).\nCamera Description - Camera angles include: shoulder-angle, high-angle, low-angle, tilt-angle, aerial, and overhead.\nCamera Description - Camera types: single-person camera, double-person camera, triple-person camera, group camera, fixed camera.\nWarm tones, cool tones, high saturation, low saturation, etc.\nSport Description: Dancing, running, skateboarding, football, tennis, table tennis, skiing, basketball, rugby, bowling, somersault, etc.\nCharacter Emotions: Anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Basic lens shift, lens zoom, lens shift right, lens shift left, lens tilt up, extended lens shift (manual lens), compound lens shift, tracking lens, volumetric lens shift.\nStylization — visual style: felt style, 3D cartoon, pixel art, stop motion, 3D game, claymation, anime, watercolor painting, black and white animation, oil painting — special effects in photography with lens axis shift, time-lapse photography.","Create a 5-second animated script based on the image.","H:\\LLM2\\Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-abliterated-Q8_0\\ggml-model-q8_0.gguf","H:\\LLM2\\Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-abliterated-Q8_0\\mmproj-model-f16.gguf",2048,4096,8192,8192,-1,0.7,1723,"randomize"],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":4,"type":"easy showAnything","pos":[1241.093424430023,905.3859556120627],"size":[444.71454453141314,290.1740131432182],"flags":{},"order":4,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"anything","name":"anything","shape":7,"type":"*","link":2}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"output","name":"output","type":"*","links":null}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-easy-use","ver":"44f067632352c449263e11f0d9b708c9fd30e989","Node name for S&R":"easy showAnything"},"widgets_values":["[0–2s] She exhales slowly, shoulders relaxing as the rifle’s scope steadies on target, her purple ponytail swaying faintly in a desert breeze that lifts the hem of her green drape; camera holds static, sunlight glinting off the scope’s lens.\n\n[3s] Her thumb flicks the trigger guard — a deliberate, quiet press — as her gaze remains locked; camera tilts subtly downward, following the barrel’s slight dip as the weapon’s weight settles into her grip.\n\n[4–5s] She lowers the rifle with controlled motion, eyes still scanning the horizon; camera pans right, revealing distant rock formations catching the fading sun, casting long shadows that creep across the sand."]},{"id":14,"type":"Text Multiline","pos":[661.0166589522063,309.2418583266357],"size":[591.4522123947667,536.9483984571056],"flags":{},"order":0,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"text"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","type":"STRING","links":[8]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"was-node-suite-comfyui","ver":"9ae952b1b435d2bd846bfe6516919b5a8b9201aa","Node name for S&R":"Text Multiline"},"widgets_values":["You are a cinematic prompt engineer for a high-end Image-to-Video (I2V) diffusion model (e.g., WAN 14B). The input is a single keyframe image. Your task is to generate a 5-second video prompt that brings this image to life with filmic rhythm, emotional nuance, and physical plausibility — **without contradicting the image’s existing visual world**.\n\nSince the image already defines style, characters, color palette, and static composition, **never re-describe them** (no “3D cartoon”, “red jacket”, “anime eyes”). Instead, focus exclusively on **what changes over time**:\n\n- **Character action**: precise, fast, physically grounded movements (e.g., “turns head”, “reaches”, “flinches”).\n- **Camera choreography**: smooth, intentional motion (e.g., “slow pan”, “slight tilt”, “static observation”) — never zoom.\n- **Dynamic lighting & atmosphere**: only if a light source is visible or implied (e.g., “firelight flickers across the face”, “daylight dims as clouds pass”, “backlight glows stronger at dusk”).\n- **Emotion through motion**: express feeling via posture, speed, or micro-gestures (e.g., “hesitates before reaching”, “blinks in surprise”, “leans forward with curiosity”).\n- **Environmental motion**: elements that respond to physics (e.g., “hair sways in breeze”, “fabric ripples”, “raindrop trails down glass”).\n\nStructure the prompt as three timed shots using **[0–2s]**, **[3s]**, and **[4–5s]**.\n\nFor each shot:\n1. Start with the **core action**.\n2. Add **motion quality** (“slowly”, “abruptly”, “gently”).\n3. Describe **camera movement** (only if it enhances the moment).\n4. Optionally animate **existing light or atmosphere** — but only if it’s present or logically inferred.\n5. Keep composition implicit: if the image uses rule of thirds, the motion should respect that space (e.g., “turns into the negative space”).\n\nRules:\n• No magic, jumps, floating, or unrealistic physics.\n• No static descriptions (objects, colors, style).\n• No zooms or abrupt cuts.\n• No explanations or extra text.\n• Write in dense, vivid prose that implies timing and emotional subtext — like a film storyboard.\n\nFormat exactly:\n[0–2s] [Action + motion + (camera) + (dynamic light/atmosphere)].  \n[3s] [Action + motion + (camera) + (dynamic light/atmosphere)].  \n[4–5s] [Action + motion + (camera) + (dynamic light/atmosphere)]."],"color":"#233","bgcolor":"#355"},{"id":5,"type":"LoadImage","pos":[405.32160194543144,912.3809294609182],"size":[263.6800537109375,426.800018310547],"flags":{},"order":1,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"image","name":"image","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"image"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"choose file to upload","name":"upload","type":"IMAGEUPLOAD","widget":{"name":"upload"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"IMAGE","name":"IMAGE","type":"IMAGE","links":[6]},{"localized_name":"MASK","name":"MASK","type":"MASK","links":null}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.44","Node name for S&R":"LoadImage"},"widgets_values":["00161 (2).png","image"]},{"id":11,"type":"UnloadAllModels","pos":[452.051227967138,815.0251354683435],"size":[173.38216449110703,26],"flags":{},"order":2,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"value","name":"value","type":"*","link":6}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"*","name":"*","type":"*","links":[9]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-unload-model","ver":"ac5ffb4ed05546545ce7cf38e7b69b5152714eed","Node name for S&R":"UnloadAllModels","aux_id":"SeanScripts/ComfyUI-Unload-Model"},"widgets_values":[]}],"links":[[2,3,0,4,0,"*"],[6,5,0,11,0,"*"],[8,14,0,3,1,"STRING"],[9,11,0,3,0,"IMAGE"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":0.7513148009015781,"offset":[275.04047705198275,-1155.3745161566494]}},"version":0.4}
