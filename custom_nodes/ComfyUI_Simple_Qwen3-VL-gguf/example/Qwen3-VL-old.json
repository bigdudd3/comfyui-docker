Her vibrant, bohemian attire contrasts with the rugged, arid environment, evoking a fusion of wild freedom and tactical discipline. The composition emphasizes her as the central figure, with the rocky terrain framing her like a natural fortress. The mood is tense, cinematic, and visually rich — a moment frozen in action before the shot is fired.\n\n---\n\n**Prompt Description (Coherent Action & Plot):**  \n*Scene:* A lone female sniper crouches in a sun-drenched desert canyon, her body low to the ground, rifle steady against the wind. She’s tracking a distant target — perhaps a rival, a threat, or a mission objective. Her eyes are locked through the scope, her breath controlled, her fingers tense on the trigger. The camera slowly pushes in as she adjusts her aim, the wind tugging at her purple ponytail and the hem of her flowing dress. The moment of tension peaks as she fires — a single, silent shot — and the camera pulls back slightly as dust kicks up from the impact zone, revealing the vastness of the canyon behind her. She exhales, satisfied, and stands, scanning the horizon.\n\n---\n\n**5-Second Disassembly (3 Segments) — Dynamic Mirror Movement**\n\n> **Segment 1 (0–1.5 sec):**  \n> *Lens Movement:* Slow zoom-in — handheld, slightly shaky to convey urgency.  \n> *Camera Angle:* Low-angle shot, close-up on her face as she peers through the scope.  \n> *Light:* Harsh midday sun — high contrast, top light casting sharp shadows on her cheek.  \n> *Emotion:* Intense focus, eyes narrowed — determination.  \n> *Stylization:* Photorealistic, cinematic, high saturation.  \n> *Composition:* Center composition — her face and rifle dominate the frame.\n\n> **Segment 2 (1.5–3.5 sec):**  \n> *Lens Movement:* Smooth pan right — the camera glides along her body, revealing her stance, boots planted, rifle braced.  \n> *Camera Angle:* Medium close-up — captures the tension in her grip and the wind ruffling her dress.  \n> *Light:* Soft backlight from the sun — golden rim light around her silhouette.  \n> *Emotion:* Calm resolve, eyes locked on target — no panic, only precision.  \n> *Stylization:* 3D game-style realism with subtle motion blur on the wind.  \n> *Composition:* Side reconstruction — the rifle and her body form a dynamic diagonal line.\n\n> **Segment 3 (3.5–5 sec):**  \n> *Lens Movement:* Rapid tilt up — camera sweeps upward from her boots to the rocky canyon walls, then pans back to her face.  \n> *Camera Angle:* Overhead angle — captures the full scene: her kneeling position, the rifle, the vast canyon behind.  \n> *Light:* Mixed light — sun glints off her hair, casting long shadows on the ground.  \n> *Emotion:* Sudden release — she fires, then exhales, a hint of triumph.  \n> *Stylization:* Black and white animation with a color burst on the rifle and her eyes.  \n> *Composition:* Wide-angle panoramic — the environment becomes the star, emphasizing scale and isolation.\n\n---\n\n**Light & Color Notes:**  \n- *Light Type:* Clear sky light + practical light (sunlight + rifle’s metallic sheen)  \n- *Time Period:* Midday — harsh, bright, no clouds  \n- *Color Tone:* Warm tones (golden sand, orange rocks) with cool accents (purple hair, blue-green fabric)  \n- *Saturation:* High — vivid colors contrast the muted earth tones\n\n---\n\n**Final Shot:**  \nA 5-second cinematic sequence that builds tension, reveals action, and ends with a wide, dramatic reveal — the moment of the shot firing, the dust rising, and the canyon looming behind her. The camera movement mirrors her mental and physical progression — from focus, to stance, to release. The mirror movement is dynamic, fluid, and emotionally resonant — a visual poem of a sniper’s resolve.\n\n---  \n*Note: This prompt is optimized for AI image/video generation, blending cinematic storytelling with precise technical descriptions.*"]},{"id":5,"type":"LoadImage","pos":[213.87872309258702,919.5230996788138],"size":[263.6800537109375,426.800018310547],"flags":{},"order":1,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"image","name":"image","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"image"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"choose file to upload","name":"upload","type":"IMAGEUPLOAD","widget":{"name":"upload"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"IMAGE","name":"IMAGE","type":"IMAGE","links":[6]},{"localized_name":"MASK","name":"MASK","type":"MASK","links":null}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.44","Node name for S&R":"LoadImage"},"widgets_values":["00161 (2).png","image"]}],"links":[[2,3,0,4,0,"*"],[6,5,0,11,0,"*"],[9,11,0,3,0,"IMAGE"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":0.5644739300537773,"offset":[24.62124606550708,-619.274409889098]},"workflowRendererVersion":"LG"},"version":0.4}
