<details>
<summary>📦 Changelog</summary>
11/10/25:

Change: Unified UI state storage — replaced per-node cdh_ui_state.json entries (e.g. "-1_579", "-1") with a single global object.
This improvement can fix incorrect persistence of the last settings when multiple Checkpoint Discovery Hub nodes were present, which could cause conflicts.

Migration/Cleanup: Auto-detect old map-based UI state; pick the most recent valid state and rewrite the file to the new flat format (auto-clean).

JS alignment:

LocalStorage key normalized (no node.id),

/set_ui_state no longer sends node_id / gallery_id,

/get_ui_state called without params — now consumes the global state.

Fix: Corrected VAELoader.vae_list() TAESD F1 encoder/decoder flag mapping so taef1 appears when both files exist.

Backward-compat: Old files are still read once and transparently migrated.
